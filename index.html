        <h1>Sofia Benavides</h1>
         <p>Junior, University of South Florida. I see my future in investment banking, working on deals that not only challenge me analytically but also allow me to make a real impact on businesses and people. With my double major in Finance and Business Analytics & Information Systems, I want to bring both technical skills and a human perspective to the work I do. My goal is to grow into a professional who clients can trust to guide them through complex decisions, while continuing to learn, collaborate, and push myself to new levels in this industry.
